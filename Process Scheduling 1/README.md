# Process Scheduling 1 Project
### Description:
These C files represent an implementation of first come first serve process scheduling.
They were completed as part of my University coursework.

***

### Contents:

 **assign1-0.c** : Base file used to create `assign1.c`.
 
 **assign1.c** : Runs the first come first serve or FCFS algorithm for process scheduling.
 
 **pslibrary.c** : Library of functions used to emulate process scheduling. Contains FCFS algorithm and helper functions.
 
 **runalla.c** : Used to run all possible input values from `0,0,0,0,0,0,0` to `60,60,60,60,60,60,60`.
 
 **pslibrary.h** : The .h file which has the function prototypes used by `pslibrary.c`.
 
 **makefile** : The makefile which was used to build and test the project.
