# Tragedy of the Commons
### Description:
This is a simulation intended to be an illustration of the metaphor [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). 
It was developed in C as part of my University coursework, and is intended to demonstrate the potential effects of unchecked greed.
